Bundle-WeBWorK version 0.01
============================

This bundle installs many of the perl prerequisites for WeBWorK, an open source 
online homework system for math and science courses.  WeBWorK also requires
mod_perl2, some libapreq2 (Apache2::*) modules, DBD::mysql, and GD but I 
left those out because IMHO it can take some sophistication to install those 
from source, especially if you did not install apache2, mysql, and libgd from 
source.  In particular, if you installed apache2, mysql and libgd from a package
manager, then also install mod_perl2, the libapreq2 perl modules, DBD::mysql, 
and GD from your package manager.

INSTALLATION

Remember, this only installs some of the perl prerequities for WeBWorK; it 
doesn't actually install WeBWorK.  To do that, see the links above. 
Also remember that this is a Bundle distribution, so CPAN treats it special.
To get that special treatment, do, for example, 

perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::WeBWorK'

and don't try doing 'perl Makefile.PL...'
